Evolutionary Design Game (Assignment 8)
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
With Ben Loomis:  
We played 3 rounds of the game based on the evolutionary design model. The first round was a simple geometric shape, the second was 'worms eye view', and the third was the floor plan of Kahn's Exeter library. Each time the right answer was found after 5 or 6 rounds.  
Then Ben gave a presentation of the principles of evolutionary design, and gave out assignment 8.
